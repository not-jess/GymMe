# GymMe
Lab project I did for my Pattern Software Design course in Binus University (_COMP6114001 - Pattern Software Design_).

GymMe is a web-based health and supplement-selling application developed using **ASP.NET** with a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach. The application's architecture is structured into distinct layers, including View, Controller, Handler, Repository, Factory, and Model. These layers work together to manage UI display, data validation, business logic, database interaction, and complex object creation. The application supports role-based access for admin, customer, and guest users, offering functionalities for account management, product handling, and transaction processing.
