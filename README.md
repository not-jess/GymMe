# GymMe
Lab project I did for my Pattern Software Design course in Binus University (_COMP6114001 - Pattern Software Design_).

Here, I developed a web-based supplement-selling application, GymMe, using **ASP.NET** and by applying **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. Key 
layers include View, Controller, Handler, Repository, Factory, and Model, each handling specific aspects like UI display, data validation, business 
logic, database interaction, and complex object creation. The application supports role-based access for admin, customer, and guest, with features for 
account management, product handling, and transaction processing. Tools used include Visual Studio and Entity Framework.
